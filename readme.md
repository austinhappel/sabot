# Plugins for the Err chat bot framework

* Enhanced Emoticons
* This is That

### Enhanced Emoticons

Allows a user to alias a response from Sabot to a keyword. Whenever the keyword is wrapped in double parentheses and emitted in the chat room, the bot will respond with whatever you saved.

#### Usage:

**To set a keyword/response:**
    
    !emoticon <keyword> <response>

**To play back the response:**

    ((keyword))


### This is That

Allows Sabot to save and remember statements about things. 

**To set a statement**

    user:   > sabot: This is that.
    sabot:  > whatever you say, user.

**To retrieve a statement**
    
    user:   > what is This?
    sabot:  > I was once told that This is that.
